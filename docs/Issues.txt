This was my first Django project, hence it's riddled with all kinds problems, here's a list of the most obvious ones.

If this list is still here it means I didn't have time to take care of these issues:
    - Bad file structure/managment
    - Bad UI/UX
    - Low quality code in some places
    - Almost definetly XSS possible when creating articles. However, only moderators can create articles, so it's not critical
    - Articles can only be edited/deleted through the admin panel; almost none moderator interface
